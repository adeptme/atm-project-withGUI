This project is a Automated Teller Machine built in **C++ Language** and utilized **wxWidgets** for its graphical user interface. Instead of using an **ATM CARD**, it will use a *flash drive*, storing its *account number* and *encrypted PIN*.
Accounts registered will be stored in a database located in the *sourceandheaderfiles* folder named **accounts.txt**.
